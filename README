This is a Drag-Drop web application created using React-Flow library
Consists of a block of tasks which can be dragged and placed on the screen
Further, you can also establish connection between tasks by clicking the black dot on a node and joining it to desired node
Since, this was just a practice project, I havent used much styling, but my attention was towards understanding the use of React-Flow library rather than styling it properly!
The code has been written in simple terms so that anyone having a good JavaScript knowledge can understand it
You can also add nodes manually by manipulating the code in Column.jsx (just add in nodes state)
This library is still new to me and I will definitely try to improve myself by learning more things!
To run locally use npm start
